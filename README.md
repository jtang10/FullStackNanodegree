# Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project in Udacity **Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**. The project is to create a movie trailer website which lists out the  name, poster and YouTube trailer in __html__ webpage. 

Only the __media__ class in `media.py` and `entertainment_center.py` file was written by myself in Python. The `fresh_tomato.py` file, which defines the webpage and integrate the python __media__ class into the webpage was provided by Udacity. 

To see the result, visit __fresh_tomato.html__. To add your own favorite movie trailer, access `media.py` to learn about the class definition and add it in `entertainment_center.py`.
